# Mapping_Earthquakes
module 14

## Project Overview
I have just been hired as a data visualization expert for the Disaster Reporting Network.  My first task is to build interactive visualizations for global earthquakes, including fault lines.  The head of the earthquake response team wants users to be able to use an informative and easy to use map in order to create buzz for the Disaster Reporting Network. 

I used JavaScript and the D3.js library to pull GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website.  I then used Leaflet and Mapbox to create the interactive maps.
