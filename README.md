# Mapping_Earthquakes
module 14

## Project Overview
I have just been hired as a data visualization expert for the Disaster Reporting Network.  My first task is to work with Sadhana to build interactive visualizations for global earthquakes, including fault lines.  Basil (the head of the earthquake response team) wants users to be able to use an informative and easy to use map in order to create buzz for the Disaster Reporting Network.

Purpose

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days

Tasks

To complete this project, use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.

Approach

Your approach will be to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. You'll use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
Now that you have an overview of the project plan, let's set up a Mapbox account and get the API token you'll need to create geographical maps.
